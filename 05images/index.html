        <h2>What's So Confusing?</h2>
        <p>
            With the progression of the ever growing world of snow sports, we now have more brands, technologies, and
            ski and snowboard shapes and sizes than ever before. With this constant progression and increasing pollution
            of the industry, we are presented with an increasingly difficult decision when considering new gear. Any
            skiier or snowboarder interested in new gear can either decide to do copious amounts of research and spend
            heaps of money and time to discover the perfect gear for them, or find a local store with professionals to
            lead them in the right direction; otherwise we are left up to the devices of marketing and coporate money
            making schemes.
        </p>

        <h2>How Can We Help?</h2>
        <p>
            Here at <strong>TRUE CARVE</strong> we aim to reduce the noise and confusion of the industry by guiding
            skiiers and snowboarders through a series of relevant questions, giving us as well as the rider important
            insights into what shape, size, and tech specs would work best for their personal riding style. That way we
            can filter an incredibly large industry of equipment down to just to the gear that we're confident you'll
            <em>love</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>What Kind Of Info Do We Use?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Height & Weight</li>
            <li>Boot Size</li>
            <li>Ride Style</li>
            <li>Terrain Preferences</li>
            <li>Level of Experience</li>
            <li>Other Important Info</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            We will still aim to give you a proper selection, because we know that snowsports are a powerful form of
            self
            expression, and in the end it all comes down to the <em>style and graphic</em>, and that decision belongs to
            you!
